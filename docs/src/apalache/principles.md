# Principles of Symbolic Model Checking with Apalache

In order to take advantage of Apalache's symbolic model checking, there are a
few principles one must bear in mind when writing TLA.

<a name="symbolicTransitions"></a>
## Assignments and symbolic transitions

Let us go back to the example [`test/tla/y2k.tla`](https://github.com/informalsystems/apalache/blob/unstable/test/tla/y2k.tla) and
run `apalache` against [`test/tla/y2k_override.tla`](https://github.com/informalsystems/apalache/blob/unstable/test/tla/y2k_override.tla):

```console
$ apalache check y2k_override.tla
```

 We can check the detailed output of the `TransitionFinderPass` in the file
`x/<timestamp>/out-transition.tla`, where `<timestamp>` looks like
`09.03-10.03.2020-508266549191958257`:

```tla
{{#include ../../../test/tla/y2k_override.tla::}}
```

As you can see, the model checker did two things:

1. It has translated several expressions that look like `x' = e` into `x' := e`.
   For instance, you can see `year' := 80` and `hasLicense' := FALSE` in
   `Init$0`. We call these expressions **assignments**.
1. It has factored the operator `Next` into two operators `Next$0` and `Next$1`.
   We call these operators **symbolic transitions**.

Pure TLA+ does not have the notions of assignments and symbolic
transitions.  However, TLC sometimes treats expressions `x' = e` and `x' \in S`
as if they were assigning a value to the variable `x'`. TLC does so
dynamically, during the breadth-first search. Apalache looks statically for assignments
among the expressions `x' = e` and `x' \in S`.

When factoring out operators into symbolic transitions, Apalache splits the
action operators `Init` and `Next` into disjunctions (e.g., `A_0 \/ ... \/ A_n`),
represented in the concrete syntax as a sequence of operator definitions of the
form

``` tla
A$0 == ...
...
A$n == ...
```

The main contract between the assignments and symbolic transitions is as
follows:

> For every variable `x` declared with `VARIABLE`, there is exactly one
> assignment of the form `x' := e` in every symbolic transition `A_n`.

If Apalache cannot find expressions with the above properties, it fails.
Consider the example
[`test/tla/Assignments20200309.tla`](https://github.com/informalsystems/apalache/blob/unstable/test/tla/Assignments20200309.tla):

```tla
{{#include ../../../test/tla/Assignments20200309.tla::}}
```

Running the checker with

```bash
apalache check Assignments20200309.tla
```

Apalache reports an error as follows:

```console
...
PASS #9: TransitionFinderPass
To understand the error, check the manual:

## Type annotations

Check the [Snowcat tutorial](../tutorials/snowcat-tutorial.md)
and [HOWTO on annotations](../HOWTOs/howto-write-type-annotations.md).

### Naturals

If you look carefully at the [HOWTO on annotations](../HOWTOs/howto-write-type-annotations.md), you will find that there
is no designated type for naturals. Indeed, one can just use the type
`Int`, whenever a natural number is required. If we introduced a special type for naturals, that would cause a lot of
confusion for the type checker. What would be the type of the literal `42`? That depends on, whether you extend
`Naturals` or `Integers`. And if you extend `Naturals` and later somebody else extends your module and also `Integers`,
should be the type of `42` be an integer?

Apalache still allows you to extend `Naturals`. However, it will treat all number-like literals as integers. This is
consistent with the view that the naturals are a subset of the integers, and the integers are a subset of the reals.
Classically, one would not define subtraction for naturals. However, the module `Naturals`
defines binary minus, which can easily drive a variable outside of `Nat`. For instance, see the following example:

```tla
{{#include ../../../test/tla/NatCounter.tla::}}
```

Given that you will need the value `Int` for a type annotation, it probably does not make a lot of sense to
extend `Naturals` in your own specifications, as you will have to extend `Integers` for the type annotation too. We are
currently working on a different kind of type annotations, which would not require `Int`.

## Recursive operators and functions

**WARNING:** In our experience, it is hard to check recursive operators and functions in Apalache:

- Recursive operators need additional annotations.
- Resursive operators and functions usually apply `CHOOSE`, which is hard to implement faithfully without blow up the
  SMT encoding.

Hence, we recommend using the operators `FoldSet` and `FoldSeq`:

```tla
{{#include ../../../src/tla/Apalache.tla:72:93}}
```

These operators are treated by Apalache in a more efficient manner than recursive operators. They are always terminating
and thus do not require an annotation that specifies an upper bound on the number of operator iterations. We are
preparing a tutorial on this topic.

### Recursive operators

In the preprocessing phase, Apalache replaces every application of a user operator with its body. We call this process "
operator inlining". This cannot be done for recursive operators, for two reasons:

1. A recursive operator may be non-terminating (although a non-terminating operator is useless in TLA+);

1. A terminating call to an operator may take an unpredicted number of iterations.

However, in practice, when one fixes specification parameters (that is,
`CONSTANTS`), it is usually easy to find a bound on the number of operator
iterations. For instance, consider the following specification:

```tla
{{#include ../../../test/tla/Rec6.tla::}}
```

It is clear that the expression `Sum(S)` requires the number of iterations that
is equal to `Cardinality(S) + 1`. Moreover, the expression `set \subseteq
1..N` is an invariant, and thus every call `Sum(set)` requires up to `N+1`
iterations.

When we can find an upper bound on the number of iterations, Apalache can
unroll the recursive operator up to this bound. To this end, we define two
additional operators. For instance:

```tla
{{#include ../../../test/tla/MC_Rec6.tla::}}
```

In this case, Apalache unrolls every call to `Sum` exactly `UNROLL_TIMES_Sum`
times, that is, four times. On the default branch, Apalache places
`UNROLL_DEFAULT_Sum`, that is, 0.

All recursively defined operators should follow this convention where, for every such operator `Oper`, the user defines both `UNROLL_TIMES_Oper`, which expands to a positive integer value, and `UNROLL_DEFAULT_Oper`, which expands to some default value `Oper(args*)` should take, if the computation would require more than `UNROLL_TIMES_Oper` recursive calls.
At present, we only support literals (e.g. `4`) or primitive arithmetic expressions (e.g. `2 + 2`) in the body of `UNROLL_TIMES_Oper`.

#### Recursive functions

Apalache offers limited support for recursive functions. However, read the
warning below on why you should not use recursive functions. The restrictions
are as follows:

 1. Apalache supports recursive functions that return an integer or a Boolean.

 1. As Apalache's simple type checker is not able to find the type of a
recursive function, all uses of a recursive function should come with a type
annotation.

 1. As in TLC, the function domain must be a finite set.

The example below shows a recursive function that computes the factorial of `n`.


```tla
{{#include ../../../test/tla/Rec8.tla::}}
```

Check other examples in
[`test/tla`](https://github.com/informalsystems/apalache/tree/unstable/test/tla) that
start with the prefix `Rec`.

**Why you should avoid recursive functions.** Sometimes, recursive functions
concisely describe the function that you need. The nice examples are the
factorial function (see above) and Fibonacci numbers (see
[Rec3](https://github.com/informalsystems/apalache/blob/unstable/test/tla/Rec3.tla)).
However, when you define a recursive function over sets, the complexity gets
ugly really fast.

Consider the example
[Rec9](https://github.com/informalsystems/apalache/blob/unstable/test/tla/Rec9.tla),
which computes set cardinality. Here is a fragment of the spec:

```tla
{{#include ../../../test/tla/Rec9.tla:19:32}}
```

Since we cannot fix the order, in which the set elements are evaluated, we
define function `Card` over `SUBSET NUMS`, that is, all possible subsets of
`NUMS`. Apalache translates the function in a quantifier-free theory of SMT.
Hence, in this case, Apalache expands `SUBSET NUMS`, so it introduces
`2^|NUMS|` sets! Further, Apalache writes down the SMT constraints for the
domain of `Card`. As a result, it produces `NUMS * 2^|NUMS|` constraints.
As you can see, recursive functions over sets explode quite fast.

It is usually a good idea to use recursive operators over sets rather than
recursive functions. The downside is that you have to provide an upper bound on
the number of the operator iterations. The upside is that recursive operators
are usually unrolled more efficiently. (If they contain only constant
expressions, they are even computed by the translator!) For instance, set
cardinality does not require `2^|NUMS|` constraints, when using a recursive
operator.
